<h1>LipNet: Efficient and Inclusive Communication with Lipreading Technology</h1>
<br> 
<h3>Overview</h3>
The LipNet model is designed to address the need for efficient and inclusive communication across various domains. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, LipNet aims to decode spoken language from visual cues, particularly focusing on lip movements and facial expressions.

<h3>Dataset</h3>
The dataset consists of videos, each lasting 3 seconds with a frame rate of 25fps. It is divided into two parts: the video files and corresponding text alignment files. The video files capture the lip movements and facial expressions, while the alignment files provide the transcribed text associated with each video.

<h3>Loading Data</h3>
Two functions are provided for loading the dataset: one for loading video data and another for loading text alignment data.
<br>
<ul>
	<li>
			<strong>Load Video:</strong> This function takes the path to a video file as input, loads the video frames, converts them to grayscale, extracts the region of interest (mouth area), and normalizes the region to facilitate further processing.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Alignment Function:</strong> This function reads the text alignment file corresponding to the loaded video, tokenizes the text, and prepares it for further processing.
The load_data function is responsible for parallel loading of both the video and alignment files, facilitating seamless integration of visual and textual data.
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Core Components</h3>
The core components of the LipNet model include:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>
		Spatio-temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction.
	</li>
	<li>
		Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (Bi-LSTMs) for sequence modeling.
	</li>
	<li>
		Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss as a key element for training the model.
	</li>
</ul>
This combination of methods enables LipNet to effectively decode spoken language from visual cues captured in the input videos.
<h3>Training Process</h3>
The dataset is divided into batches, each containing 500 samples. Out of these, 450 samples are designated for training, and 50 samples are reserved for testing to evaluate the model's performance.

During training, batches comprising both video frames and corresponding text data are fed into the LipNet model. The model learns to predict text sequences (spoken words) from the video data by analyzing lip movements and facial expressions.
